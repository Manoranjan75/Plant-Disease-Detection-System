## 🌟 Project Overview  
The **Plant Disease Detection System** is an innovative machine learning application designed to help farmers, agricultural professionals, and gardening enthusiasts identify plant diseases quickly and accurately.  

Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **PlantVillage Dataset**, the system can analyze plant leaf images and provide **instant disease diagnosis** with **confidence scores** and **treatment recommendations**.  

---

### 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Plant diseases cause significant crop losses worldwide (**20–40% annually**)  
- Traditional disease identification requires expert knowledge  
- Late detection leads to widespread crop damage  
- Manual inspection is time-consuming and often inaccurate  

---

### 💡 Solution  
Our CNN-based system provides:  
- ✅ Instant disease detection from leaf images  
- ✅ Treatment recommendations for identified diseases  
- ✅ User-friendly web interface for easy access  
- ✅ Batch processing for multiple images  

---

## 🎯 Features  

### 🔍 Core Features  
- **Multi-class Disease Classification**: Detect 38 different plant diseases across 14 crop species  
- **Real-time Prediction**: Get instant results with confidence scores  
- **Treatment Suggestions**: Receive actionable treatment recommendations  
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple images simultaneously  
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit application
